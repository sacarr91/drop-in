                <h1>How to get Sponsored!</h1>
                
                <p>Getting Started with skateboarding? Well, that's the first step to getting sponsored if you are seeking this adventurous and captivating pastime.
                    Many people in the skateboarding community fulfill various roles that provide opportunities to become a sponsored skateboarder.
                    Any individual with the appropriate training, skills and attitude holds the potential to become a sponsored skateboarder. Sponsorships can include 
                    skateboard equipment, merchandise, fashion, and other consumer products. A critical factor in getting sponsorships is honing and cultivating your skills, then 
                    an individual can begin to build an audience, or provide a repository that demonstrates a record of achievement. This could be by building a youtube channel,
                    instagram, facebook, tiktok or other online media outlets. This app is intentionally designed to provide users with a cohesive platform that can allow for a central location to facilitate connecting communities, businesses and skateboarders.
                    By design this app can allow friends, family and anyone in the community that wants to sponsor an aspiring skateboarder. With this app, you can achieve sponsors of all kinds easily.

                    Once an individual has established a reference point for their achievements they can begin to look for sponsorships in two distinct ways.
                    The first and most important way to become sponsored is to participate in the local skateboard community. Almost everywhere from small towns to enormous cities will have a skateboard community,
                    if your area does not, that means you have to start it! By getting involved with the community you can begin to develop relationships that will help you identify the sponsors you would like to acquire.
                    Getting involved can mean participating in contests, spending time at the local skate shops, attending skateboard video screenings (usually at skate shops ðŸ˜‰) and most importantly,
                    spending time in designated skateboard and action sport facilities. It's important to be respectful of the community you are in, and if there are not facilities for you to use, then that is a great opportunity 
                    to get involved with the local government to change that! I have personally participated and watched many generations of skateboarders come together and negotiate with city planners to provide facilities.
                    It is important to remember that sponsorship is closely related to community support so make sure to represent yourself appropriately. Any individual that has made a mark on their local community especially in
                    skateboarding can leverage that exposure to acquire sponsorship. Sponsors are concerned with having their services and/or products recognized, and the skateboarding community
                    is squarely in the focus as the sport is captivating and inspiring even to non-skateboarders. Ensuring that your attitude and reach demonstrate the best version of yourself is critical to impressing and convincing 
                    a sponsor to select you.
